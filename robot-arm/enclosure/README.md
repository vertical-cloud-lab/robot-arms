# PiPER enclosure

Figures and numbers behind the enclosure discussion in
[#229](https://github.com/vertical-cloud-lab/byu-vcl/issues/229).

| Figure | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `piper-reach.png` | The PiPER and gripper, rendered from AgileX's own URDF, and a side view of where the fingertip can reach |
| `enclosure-options.png` | The quarter, half and full domes as sketched, plus spot D with the arm centred, all at one scale |
| `cb154-arm-locations.png` | Spots D and E on [`cb154.pdf`](../../cb154.pdf), the transformer pocket next to D, and the ceiling height available for a two-level setup |

The enclosure chosen for spot D is modelled part by part in [`dome/`](dome/), with a cut list,
3D exports and an assembly GIF.

The two-level version, with the arm on a raised plywood deck and 0.5 m of workspace underneath,
is in [`hutch/`](hutch/): five structural options compared, a cut list, a section, an exploded
view and an assembly GIF.

A low shelf for the arm to pick from is in [`shelf/`](shelf/): where it sits relative to the arm,
how to make item positions repeatable, how stiff it needs to be, a cut list, a 3D view and a
dimensioned drawing. It also covers the changes needed on the raised deck.

To regenerate the figures, run `xvfb-run -a python render_figures.py`. The script clones
`agilexrobotics/piper_ros` at `ac41fcb` into `/tmp` for the URDF and meshes.

## PiPER numbers

These come from the [user manual](https://static.generation-robots.com/media/agilex-piper-user-manual.pdf).

| | Arm | Two-finger gripper |
|---|---|---|
| Reach / stroke | 626.75 mm working radius | 0–70 mm opening. There is also a 100 mm version, and the SDK has a 70/100 mm travel setting |
| Payload / force | 1.5 kg | 40 N rated, 50 N max |
| Mass | 4.2 kg | 0.5 kg |
| Repeatability | ±0.1 mm | ±0.5 mm |
| Power | 24 V (24–26 V), ≤120 W peak, ≤40 W typical | 24 V, ≤50 W |
| Interface | CAN (USB–CAN adapter included) | Through the arm |
| Mounting | Four M5 threaded holes, 70 mm spacing | Flange |
| Joint range | J1 ±154°, J2 0–195°, J3 −175–0°, J4 ±106°, J5 ±75°, J6 ±100° | |
| Joint speed | 180 / 195 / 180 / 225 / 225 / 225 °/s | |

The manual also asks for "a relatively open area" because the arm has no obstacle sensing.
It is rated IP22.

## Reach

These values are computed here from the URDF, with the fingertip taken as 140 mm past the flange.

- **Flange reach:** 0.63 m from the base axis, which matches the 626 mm spec.
- **Fingertip reach:** 0.77 m horizontally.
- **Fingertip height:** up to 0.89 m above the mounting surface. If the base sits at the edge of a deck, the fingertip can also reach 0.40 m below the mounting surface.
- **Rest pose:** the zero pose folds the elbow 0.28 m *behind* the base. A base pushed into a corner or against a wall hits that wall every time the arm parks.
- **Reach lost to the walls:** this is the share of the fingertip's reachable volume that falls outside the walls. It treats the workspace as a solid of revolution, since J1 plus flipping over the top covers every direction.

  | Option | Share outside the walls |
  |---|---|
  | Quarter dome as sketched | 68 % |
  | Half dome as sketched | 44 % |
  | Full dome | 0 % |
  | Spot D (1.29 × 1.36 m), arm centred | 7 % |

## Spot D in the room

Josh and Sterling added two room constraints on #229 after the first floor plan was drawn. The
floor plan now shows both:

- **The tables stand in the corner** of room 158's wall and the north wall, across door 154-1, as
  in the photos of the spot. That door leads to a separate lab and stays sealed
  ([Sterling](https://github.com/vertical-cloud-lab/byu-vcl/issues/229#issuecomment-5827668940)),
  so the tables can block its swing. The first floor plan had kept that swing clear, which put D
  1.2 m too far south.
- **A high-voltage transformer sits right next to D.** It is somewhere between the north wall,
  the pillar, the clean room and the door's swing. Nothing may be within 7.5 in (190 mm) of it or
  above it ([Gage, via Josh](https://github.com/vertical-cloud-lab/byu-vcl/issues/229#issuecomment-5827165807)).
  Its size and exact spot aren't recorded, so the floor plan shades the whole pocket.
- **Measure that gap before the dome goes up.** The tables are 1.36 m deep, so their east edge
  lands at about the door's latch jamb, which is where the pocket starts. The edge needs 190 mm or more
  of clear space to the transformer. The dome, the hutch and the shelf all stay inside the
  tables' footprint, so none of them brings anything closer. Two things do face that way, though:
  - The dome's roll-up front opens on that side, so whoever loads the cell stands in the pocket.
  - At full stretch, the centred arm's fingertip reaches 9 cm past the tables' edge.

## Mounting orientation

The arm goes on upright
([Sterling](https://github.com/vertical-cloud-lab/byu-vcl/issues/229#issuecomment-5826480282)).
For reference, from the [side-mount check](https://github.com/vertical-cloud-lab/byu-vcl/issues/229#issuecomment-5826036827)
on #229:

- **Side mounting is supported.** The firmware has an installation-position setting with three
  values: upright, side-left and side-right. It is byte 5 of CAN frame `0x151`, from firmware
  S-V1.5-2. That setting is how the controller knows which way gravity points, so it has to
  match the real mount, or gravity compensation and drag-teach will be wrong.
- **The stock `piper_ros` driver never sets it.** It sends the invalid default `0x00` in
  every `MotionCtrl_2` call.
- **Inverted (ceiling) mounting has no setting.** A two-level design can't hang the arm from
  above.

## What other labs do

From the [25 Sept survey](https://github.com/vertical-cloud-lab/byu-vcl/issues/229#issuecomment-5825893732)
on #229:

- **Learning-from-demonstration rigs mostly don't enclose the arm at all.**
  [ALOHA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13705) uses a light 20 mm extrusion cage, mostly as a camera
  mount. [DROID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12945) records in hundreds of real scenes on purpose.
  [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/il_robots) asks only for fixed cameras, a static
  background and steady lighting.
- **When the scene has to be private and consistent, labs close the box and bring their own
  light.** [CloudGripper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12786) runs 32 fully enclosed cells with their
  own LEDs, and [GreenAug](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07868) warns that a partial screen leaves
  the wrist camera looking at the room.
- **Industry uses hard guarding plus limits the controller enforces,** such as
  [UR's safety planes](https://www.universal-robots.com/manuals/EN/HTML/SW5_20/Content/prod-usr-man/software/PolyScope/content/safety_g5/Planes_g5_en.htm).
  The PiPER has joint limits only (below).

## Keeping it inside the enclosure

The PiPER SDK has three relevant settings. All are in `piper_sdk/interface/piper_interface_v2.py`.

- **`MotorAngleLimitMaxSpdSet`:** sets per-joint angle and speed limits, which are stored on the arm.
- **`CrashProtectionConfig`:** sets collision sensitivity per joint, from 0 (off) to 8.
- **`MotionCtrl_2(installation_pos=...)`:** sets the mounting orientation, either upright, left-side or right-side (firmware V1.5-2 and later). There is no inverted option.

The SDK has no Cartesian keep-in box. That check belongs in our motion code, or can be done
with walls in MoveIt's planning scene.

Prices were checked on 2026-09-25, before tax. Home Depot and Walmart block automated page
fetches, from both a CI runner and the OT-2 stream-cam Pi's residential IP, so their prices
come from search results. Confirm them in the store.

Snap clamps are easy to buy in the wrong size. Clamps sold as "3/4 in" fit 3/4 in EMT, which
is the same size as 1/2 in PVC. For 3/4 in PVC, get the ones labelled "3/4 in PVC / 1 in EMT".

Rough totals for a 1.3 × 1.4 × 1.1 m box with four sides and a top:

| Build | Approx. cost |
|---|---|
| Plain PVC and drop cloth | $265 |
| Furniture-grade PVC and Coroplast | $430 |
| 80/20 frame | $750 |
